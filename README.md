## About kitsune
The mission behind kitsune is to enable application developers to be able to build full stack **serverless / cloud-native** applications without having to learn how to program, configure or deploy cloud components. Our aim is to simplify cloud application development by enabling developers focus on the user experience and business logic, and not worry about the cloud architecture. The application architecture generated by kitsune uses serverless / native cloud components or containers. This enables applications built with kitsune to be infinitely scalable and cost effective. 

### A serverless future
Today 95% of applications on cloud are still deployed on server / IaaS components of public and private cloud. Our belief is that over the new few years the trend will shift towards cloud-native / serverless archiectures. With the adoption of smart devices amongst customers and a globally connected world, the need for applications to scale realtime is a reality. 

### Serverless Web Applications and UX Developers
kitsune framework is designed for applications that run on a browser - web applications. The most important feature of the framework is that it enables UX developers to use a html-based kitsune syntax to build any kind of full stack static/dynamic web application. The HTML-based declarative syntax of makes it extremely easy for UX engineers to get started. The kitsune compiler automatically converts the code into a serverless architecture for the target cloud. So as UX developers you do not have to spend time learning about multiple cloud providers & their components - with kitsune you get to focus on actual application logic and not the infrastructure logic. 

> kitsune is proven to be the fastest way to build serverless web
> applications on any cloud provider.

### Salient Features of the framework
 - Open Source
 - Cloud Agnostic
 - Enterprise Ready
 - Support for Hybrid and Multi cloud architectures

### Security & Compliance
kitsune compiler can be easily customised to align to an enterprise SDLC process, data and other security policies. For example, as a finance company, you might want to ensure that all applications being built in your organisation have the database on your private data-centres where as the compute can be scaled on cloud. Or as a organisation you might want all your applications to be scaled on multiple cloud providers to increase reliability. In such scenarios, creating and implementing right architecture constraints across multiple teams becomes a challenge. For such organisations, you just need to customise the kitsune compiler with the right environment constraints (example, use on-prem for storage and compute on cloud etc) and then all the teams who use kitsune to build the applications - need not worry about the compliance. 

> kitsune is the most optimal framework for large enterprises who want
> to implement a secure and compliant cloud native culture across all
> teams.

## The application-development-kit
kitsune application-development-kit contains the following modules:
| Module | Description | Live Environment <br/><small>(managed by kitsune team)</small> |
|--|--|--|
| kitsune **Dashboard** | An enterprise ready dashboard which enables developers and teams to Build, Manage and Deploy their cloud-native applications. | https://dashboard.kitsune.tools |
| kitsune **IDE** | A browser based IDE, optimised for developing full stack cloud-native apps with kitsune. | https://ide.kitsune.tools |
| kitsune **App Services** | This is a suite of micro-services like the compiler, publishing service, code optimiser, storage management etc. | https://api2.kitsune.tools

### Repository Structure
*Note: Currently this single repository contains all the modules of the kitsune application-development-kit. As the project matures, it would be split into appropriate individual repositories.*
