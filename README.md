Serverless for the HTML world
=============================
The Kitsune application development toolkit is an **open-source suite of web development, content management, and serverless deployment tools**, which enable web developers to build full stack **serverless / cloud-native** applications without having to learn how to program, configure or deploy *cloud components*. Our aim is to simplify cloud application development by enabling developers focus on the user experience and business logic, and not worry about the cloud architecture.

The application architecture generated by kitsune uses [serverless / native cloud](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/DEFINITION.md#cncf-cloud-native-definition-v10) components or containers, enabling applications built with kitsune to be infinitely scalable and cost effective.

The toolkit has all the modules required to build end to end applications with kitsune. This is the same stack avaialble under [kitsune's managed hosting environment](https://dashboard.kitsune.tools) for developers to quickly learn how to build applications with kitsune. Once comfortable with the experience, feel free to explore the optimizations continuously built and updated on our managed hosting environment, which offer you the ability to get up and running live with your project in a few minutes.

## Features
- Open Source
- Cloud Agnostic
- Enterprise Ready
- Support for Hybrid and Multi cloud architectures
- [Extensible Language Components](https://www.getkitsune.com/features)! (Including reports, seo, payments, and more)

## Installation
- Get the entire toolkit by cloning this repository
    ```bash
    > git clone https://github.com/GetKitsune/application-development-kit.git
    ```
- That's all! Based on your requirement, build any module under the root, or try our live environment, both of which work very nicely with each other, providing a seamless experience.

## The application-development-kit
The following modules are part of our toolkit: 

| kitsune Module | Description | Live Environment |

## About
### A serverless future
Today 95% of applications on cloud are still deployed on server / IaaS components of public and private cloud. Our belief is that over the new few years the trend will shift towards cloud-native / serverless archiectures. With the adoption of smart devices amongst customers and a globally connected world, the need for applications to scale realtime is a reality. 

### Serverless Web Applications and UX Developers
kitsune framework is designed for applications that run on a browser - web applications. The most important feature of the framework is that it enables UX developers to use a html-based kitsune syntax to build any kind of full stack static/dynamic web application. The HTML-based declarative syntax of makes it extremely easy for UX engineers to get started. The kitsune compiler automatically converts the code into a serverless architecture for the target cloud. So as UX developers you do not have to spend time learning about multiple cloud providers & their components - with kitsune you get to focus on actual application logic and not the infrastructure logic. 

> kitsune is proven to be the fastest way to build serverless web
> applications on any cloud provider.

### Security & Compliance
kitsune compiler can be easily customised to align to an enterprise SDLC process, data and other security policies. For example, as a finance company, you might want to ensure that all applications being built in your organisation have the database on your private data-centres where as the compute can be scaled on cloud. Or as a organisation you might want all your applications to be scaled on multiple cloud providers to increase reliability. In such scenarios, creating and implementing right architecture constraints across multiple teams becomes a challenge. For such organisations, you just need to customise the kitsune compiler with the right environment constraints (example, use on-prem for storage and compute on cloud etc) and then all the teams who use kitsune to build the applications - need not worry about the compliance. 

> kitsune is the most optimal framework for large enterprises who want
> to implement a secure and compliant cloud native culture across all
> teams.

NOTE: *The kitsune application runtime has no browser footprint. No application logic (written in kitsune's language) is emitted in the output, this makes any downstream integrations (using k-script) absolutely secure.*

## Repository
#### Structure
*Note: Currently this single repository contains all the modules of the kitsune application-development-kit. As the project matures, it would be split into appropriate individual repositories.*

### kitsune Dashboard
The dashboard enables development teams to build and manage multiple serverless applications in one single place.

You can experience the hosted version of the dashboard - https://dashboard.kitsune.tools

### kitsune IDE
This a browser based IDE which has the provides the best tools to build a full stack serverless web application with kitsune.

### kitsune App-Services
A suite of micro-services that enable various aspects of application development & deployment in kitsune. It includes the following projects:

 - kitsuneServer
 This contains the compiler (lexical parser, syntax parser, IL code generator), `k-string` (AI based content summarisation) handler, existing application crawl service, DNS validator and application Build service. 
 - Optimiser
 This module takes care of the load time optimisation of the application. For web applications, it automatically identifies the static assets (like .js, .css, .jpg, .png etc) and creates a compressed and minified version. Optimiser also maintains the version of each file so that as a developer you do not have to worry about cache invalidation etc when you publish a new version of your application.
 - Routing
 This module is responsible to build a route-tree, each time a project is built. Routing module creates a unique regex tree for every kitsune projects and ensures that no two path lead to the same asset. This ensures that any potential URL conflict is identified during the Build process itself.
 - PublishService
 This module is responsible to deploy your application to the selected infrastructure provider. 
 - KAdmin
 When you build a new dynamic web application with kitsune, the framework enables a CMS `(<your_project_url>/k-admin)` to manage the dynamic properties of the application. This enables developers to quickly test multiple scenarios by entering test data into the database via the CMS. 

### Application Development Process with kitsune
<p align="center"><img src="/screenshots/kit-sdlc.png" height="480" title="kit sdlc"/></p>

 1. Import your design/html files into a kitsune project. Each html file representing a user-view of your application.
 2. Create/Import your data-model (the dynamic properties of your application)
 3. Use the kitsune's declarative syntax to map the properties and the business logic on to the html files. 
 4. As you write your application logic with kitsune, you can Build the project and check/review the serverless architecture built for your application.
 5. You can also enter test data against the data-model using the `k-admin` 
 6. Once your application development and testing is complete, you can publish your application to the appropriate cloud infrastructure of your choice.
